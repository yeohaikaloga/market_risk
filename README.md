# Cotton Market data Risk project 

## Project Overview

**Market Risk Analysis Toolkit** is a Python-based library and framework designed for analyzing market risks, simulating price series, and calculating various financial risk metrics with a focus on commodities markets such as cotton.  
This project provides modular components to:  

- Generate synthetic price data series based on market parameters.  
- Model basis risk and workflows specific to cotton trading (i.e., `cotton_basis_workflow`).  
- Store and manage market data efficiently using a dedicated database module.  
- Provide utilities for contract management and price handling.

## Features

- Synthetic price generation with configurable parameters.  
- Specialized workflow implementation for cotton basis risk management.  
- Modular architecture separating concerns into `contract`, `price`, `db`, and `utils`.  
- Easy extensibility for adding new commodities or risk models.  
- Simple database integration for storing generated data and results.
